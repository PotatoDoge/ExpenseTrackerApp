### ðŸ“Œ **Notes**
- Categorizing expenses helps users understand where their money is going, making it easier to identify areas for saving.
- Flexible category management allows users to adapt the system to their personal or business needs, supporting different types of categories like personal, professional, or mixed categories.
- It may be helpful to allow users to assign multiple categories to an expense (e.g., a business trip could fall under both "Business" and "Travel").
- Tags and attachments provide valuable context for each expense and can make it easier to reference supporting documents (such as receipts or invoices) when needed.
- Attachments should be handled carefully to ensure security and compliance with privacy regulations (e.g., if receipts contain sensitive information).
- Tags allow for additional flexibility in organizing expenses, and they can be a quick way to search for related expenses across categories.
