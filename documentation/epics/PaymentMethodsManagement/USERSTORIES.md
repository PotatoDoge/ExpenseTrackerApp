## User Stories

### 2.1 As a user, I want to select a payment method when creating an expense
- So that I can track how I paid for each transaction.

### 2.2 As a user, I want to view the payment method used for each expense
- So that I can analyze my payment habits and sources.

### 2.3 As a user, I want to edit the payment method of an existing expense
- So that I can correct mistakes if the wrong method was selected.

### 2.4 As a user, I want to manage my list of saved cards and payment methods
- So that I can easily select from my frequently used options (e.g., Visa, Mastercard, Wallet, Bank Transfer).

# ðŸ“Œ Notes
- For now, keep payment methods simple (e.g., Cash, Credit Card, Debit Card, Bank Transfer, Wallet).
- Later versions could link specific card entities for richer data. (Use 2.4 for this)
